#
# 
# Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of
# lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k
# times.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# s = "aaabb", k = 3
# 
# Output:
# 3
# 
# The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
# s = "ababbc", k = 2
# 
# Output:
# 5
# 
# The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is
# repeated 3 times.
