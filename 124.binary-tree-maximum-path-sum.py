#
# Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
# 
# For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some
# starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The
# path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the
# root.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3]
# 
# ⁠      1
# ⁠     / \
# ⁠    2   3
# 
# Output: 6
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# 
# -10
# / \
# 9  20
# /  \
# 15   7
# 
# Output: 42
