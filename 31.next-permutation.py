#
# Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the
# lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
# 
# If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest
# possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
# 
# The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.
# 
# Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its
# corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
# 
# 1,2,3 → 1,3,2
# 3,2,1 → 1,2,3
# 1,1,5 → 1,5,1
